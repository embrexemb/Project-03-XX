    "Learning\" [RW2006]. It illustrates an example of complex kernel engineering and\n",
    "hyperparameter optimization using gradient ascent on the\n",

    "  RBF kernel with a large length-scale enforces this component to be smooth;\n",

    "  of this periodic component, controlling its smoothness, is a free parameter.\n",
    "  In order to allow decaying away from exact periodicity, the product with an\n",
    "  RBF kernel is taken. The length-scale of this RBF component controls the\n",

    "  RationalQuadratic kernel component, whose length-scale and alpha parameter,\n",

    "  According to [RW2006], these irregularities can better be explained by\n",
    "  a RationalQuadratic than an RBF kernel component, probably because it can\n",

    "\n",
    "- a \"noise\" term, consisting of an RBF kernel contribution, which shall\n",
